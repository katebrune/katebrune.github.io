Hi ðŸ‘‹ This project is my personal blog. It's also a space for me to play around with technologies that I'm interested in. You'd probably be interested in it if you're into:

- NextJS
- Tailwind
- React Testing Library
- Storybook
- Github Actions

## Details

### Application

#### Framework

This application uses the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) framework. I like working with the Next framework because I think they're opinionated about the right things. I also think SSR is cool and fun. It also is extremely easy to deploy a static site on github pages with Next.

#### Styling

For styling I used [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/). I love using tailwind because it naturally keeps you from creating abstractions too early, and let's you get what you want on the page faster. Their docs are also great.

#### Icons

For icons I used [OpenMoji](https://openmoji.org/). Randomly found them but I think they're cute as hell and super easy to work with.

### Testing

#### Unit Testing

For unit testing I used [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) and Jest. I like that React Testing Library reinforces the idea of testing behavior and experience versus testing the internals of a component, I think that just makes sense. In the future I'd like to take a look at [Cypress component testing](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/component-testing/introduction) for unit testing.

#### Functional Testing

For functional testing I used [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/). I love Cypress, but i love it even more when I'm using it with [cypress-cucumber-preprocessor](https://github.com/TheBrainFamily/cypress-cucumber-preprocessor). Creating reusable step definitions makes it super quick to write a test, and being able to read through the feature spec in english (versus trying to parse through `describe` and `it` blocks) makes the purpose of the test, and functionality of the app abundantly clear.

#### Visual Testing

As a developer, CSS and styling scares me. You accidentally delete a random class name and suddenly your app looks like hot trash, and your pipeline is still green. I wanted a way to be able to verify that the changes I'm making aren't breaking my application styling unless _they're intentional_, and I wanted it to happen without me having to just stare at a browser (i mean).

I already had [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) set up on my application, so I ended up adding [snapshot](https://storybook.js.org/addons/@storybook/addon-storyshots) testing to the storybook setup. It's nice because it can verify my components and pages haven't changed. I can change the viewport to verify that the app is consistent across mobile, table, and web. It's some peace of mind we all need.

#### Accessibility

Accessibility is important when developing frontend applications, but a lot of the time it gets pushed off. I added an [a11y test](https://storybook.js.org/addons/@storybook/addon-a11y) to my setup that uses storybook to make sure my components pass accessibility checks. It runs during my pipeline so I know my code is accessible before merging and deploying.

### Pipeline & Deployment

#### On Commit

On commit, a [hook](https://prettier.io/docs/en/precommit.html) runs prettier to format all the files in the commit. It's pretty sweet because I don't have to worry about how my code looks when I write it, it's always gonna be formatted consistently eventually.

#### On Push

On push, a github actions job is triggered. First i build the app and cache it (so i don't have to build it at every step). I run ESLint, unit tests, functional tests, accessibility checks, and visual regression tests.

#### Master?

During the github actions job, if the branch is master, it will deploy the application to github pages. I export the app to static files, and then those files are pushed to the `release` branch of this repository. This repository is set up so that when there are changes to the `release` branch, the code on that branch is redeployed to github pages.
